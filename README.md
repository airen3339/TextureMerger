TextureMerger
=============

A tool to take multiple textures and combine them together to use a single one.
Supports N by N textures with preview, up to 8x8 images and has a preference system to keep the settings over sessions.

Known issue / Todo list:<br>
-Preference should be a default value while overridable in the main window.<br>
-Fix the +/- buttons on each row to keep their size.<br>
-Add the preview size as a parameter in the prefs.<br>
-rework of the preference window into defaults and actual preferences.<br>
