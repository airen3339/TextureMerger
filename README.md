TextureMerger
=============

A tool to take multiple textures and combine them together to use a single one.<br>
Supports N by N textures with preview, up to 8x8 images and has a preference system to keep the settings over sessions.<br>
<br>
It also now support having preview of several sizes to ease big picture input preview, or small screen that wouldn't be able to display all the full size preview.<br>
<br>
Known issue / Todo list:<br>
-Fix the +/- buttons on each row to keep their size.<br>
-Make sure we have the right size for the buttons when changing the preview size.<br>
